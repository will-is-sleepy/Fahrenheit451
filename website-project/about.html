    <h1>CHARACTERS</h1>
    <h2>Guy Montag</h2>

    <p>
      Montag is the main character and a fireman who first depicts the dystopian
      society in which he lives as seen through the eyes of a worker loyal to
      it, then as seen through the eyes of a man in struggle over it, and last
      as seen through the eyes of someone determined to escape it. Montag lacks
      knowledge for the most of the novel and just trusts what he hears.
      Montag's transformation is inspired by Clarisse McClellan, despite the
      fact that they have only recently gotten to know each other.

    <h2>Clarisse McClellan</h2>

    <p>
      Clarisse refers to herself as "seventeen and crazy," and her rapid-fire
      inquiries and statements reveal an inquisitive and open mind to the world
      around her. Clarisse's inquisitive mind intrigues Montag despite his
      reaction that she "think[s] too many things," especially when he contrasts
      her to his own numb, obedient wife. Montag is also intrigued by Clarisse's
      relatives. Clarisse's family converses into the night while sitting around
      a table with the lights on, as opposed to being addicted to wall-sized
      television screens.
    </p>
    <h2>Mildred Montag</h2>

    <p>
      The only significant character in the novel who lacks any possibility of
      addressing her internal difficulties is Mildred. Her attempt at suicide
      indicates that she is suffering greatly and that her obsession with
      television is a coping mechanism for avoiding facing her life. But she has
      buried her genuine emotions extremely deeply. Even her own failed suicide
      attempt seems to have escaped her notice. She is a terrifying character
      since the reader would anticipate getting to know the protagonist's wife
      extremely well, but instead finds her to be unfeeling, aloof, and
      unreadable. Given that she is Montag's wife, her betrayal of him is even
      more terrible than Beatty's.
    </p>
    <h2>Captain Beatty</h2>

    <p>
      Beatty is a contradictory, multifaceted character. He is a book burner who
      is well-versed in literature and who, at one point, undoubtedly cared
      deeply about books. Note that Beatty's entire address to Montag about the
      history of the firemen is oddly ambivalent and simultaneously laced with
      irony, sarcasm, passion, and sorrow. Beatty calls books dangerous weapons,
      but he brutally manipulates Montag using his own book on learning.
