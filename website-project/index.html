      Guy Montag is a fireman. In his world, where television rules and
      literature is on the brink of extinction, firemen start fires rather than
      put them out. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the
      printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never
      questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day
      to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her
      television "family." But then he meets an eccentric young neighbor,
      Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn't live in fear
      and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books
      instead of the mindless chatter of television. When Mildred attempts
      suicide and Clarisse suddenly disappears, Montag begins to question
      everything he has ever known. He starts hiding books in his home, and when
      his pilfering is discovered, the fireman has to run for his life.
